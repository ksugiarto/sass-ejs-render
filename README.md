## Sass EJS Render

This is a **research** repository to built a proof of concept for a dynamic CSS creation.

Using `gulp` to input dynamic values to the EJS file (this value can be taken from actual config file's value). Then will convert it to Sass variable in `.scss` file. Then will convert the `.scss` file to `.css`.

See `gulpfile.js` for its full configuration.
